## About 
This repository contains two projects: 
The first project, named tasks.ipynb contains 5 tasks, each task will be associated to a lecture presented during this semester, the second part of the project will be analysing the Iris flower dataset:

## Part 1:

## Running the code
1. Install Anaconda
2. Install Visual Studio Code.
3. Clone repository 
4. Open repository in Visual Studio Code 


## Part 2:

The second project is about analysing the Iris flower dataset associated with Ronald A Fischer: 

                        Iris-virginica - Iris-versicolor - Iris-setosa

Each of them is measured in four different variables: 

_sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width_

We will conduct different types of analysis based on the data provided:

_Sepal Length_: This variable represents the length of the sepal, it is measured in centimeters (cm) and ranges from 4.3 cm to 7.9 cm in the Iris dataset.  
_Sepal Width_: This variable represents the width of the sepal and is also measured in centimeters (cm). It ranges from 2.0 cm to 4.4 cm.  
_Petal Length_: This variable represents the length of the petal. It is also measured in centimeters (cm) and ranges from 1.0 cm to 6.9 cm.  
_Petal Width_: This variable represents the width of the petal and is also measured in centimeters (cm). It ranges from 0.1 cm to 2.5 cm.  

Conclusions:
* Iris-virginica has the largest petal length and petal width.
* Iris-setosa has the smallest petal length. 
* The measurements of Iris-versicolor fall between those of Iris-virginica and Iris-setosa, showcasing an intermediate range of values compared to the other two species.
* The difference in petal length between Iris-setosa and Iris-versicolor is much larger compared to the disparity between Iris-setosa and Iris-virginica.
* Iris-setosa has the smallest petal width, the difference between Iris-setosa and Iris-versicolor is much notable than the difference between Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica.
* Iris-virginica has the highest petal width. However, its sepal width is smaller than the Iris-setosa, which has the widest sepal in the group. 
* Through our analysis we can see that although the sepal length of Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica can be equally small, the Iris-virginica can get a much longer sepal than the Versicolor. 
* The sepal width of the Iris Setosa and Iris Virginica can get be equally small, however when meassuring the largest values between both flower types the Iris-setosa has a higher sepal record.
