Part 2:

In this project we will analyse a file dataset about three different classes of flower: 

                        Iris-virginica - Iris-versicolor - Iris-setosa

Each of them is measured in four different variables: 

sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

We will conduct different types of analysis based on the data provided:

Sepal Length: This variable represents the length of the sepal, it is measured in centimeters (cm) and ranges from 4.3 cm to 7.9 cm in the Iris dataset.
Sepal Width: This variable represents the width of the sepal and is also measured in centimeters (cm). It ranges from 2.0 cm to 4.4 cm.
Petal Length: This variable represents the length of the petal. It is also measured in centimeters (cm) and ranges from 1.0 cm to 6.9 cm.
Petal Width: This variable represents the width of the petal and is also measured in centimeters (cm). It ranges from 0.1 cm to 2.5 cm.

The first step is analysing the variables reflected in the historgram:
Iris Virginca has the largest petal length and petal width.
Iris Setosa has the smallest petal length. 
Iris Versicolor meassurements are between those of Iris Virginica and Iris Setosa.
The range between Iris Setosa and Iris Versicolor petal length is much bigger than the Iris Setosa vs Iris Virginica

Iris Setosa has the smallest petal width, the difference between Iris Setosa and Iris Versicolor is much notable than the difference between Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica.
Iris Virginica has the highest petal width. However, it's sepal width is smaller than the Iris Setosa, which has the widest sepal in the group. 

Creating the scatter plot we can have a better view of the measures presented, I opted by adding (max) and (minimum) value for my scatterplot in order to see how long or how small can get each of the variables depending on the flower type. 
Through that analysis we can see that although the sepal length of iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica can be equuall small, the Iris Virginica can get a much longer sepal than the Versicolor. 
The sepal width of the Iris Setosa and Iris Virginica can get be equally small, however when it comes to measure the largest values between both flower types the Iris Setosa has a higher sepal record.
